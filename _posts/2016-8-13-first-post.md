title: "New Theory Blog"

We're starting a theory student blog!  The idea is, this is a collaborative blog
about theoretical computer science, where people can post about interesting
things they're learning / have learnt. The goal is to help everyone learn from
each other, and also have a forum for student discussion.

Hopefully this will help make TCS concepts more accessible: Sometimes reading
the original paper is not the best / most efficient way to learn something, and
there are several perspectives or proofs of the same thing that are not
explicitly written down in the literature, but are known in the community. We
hope this blog will be a way to share this knowledge among theory students.

One important aspect is, we want this to feel like an informal place to learn
and discuss -- think more like chalk talks than STOC talks. It's fine to have
rough calculations, sketched figures, etc -- the emphasis is on explaining
things nicely. And we want to encourage asking clarifying questions and
discussing in the comments.

## On posts:
- Posts can be about anything technical that other students may find
  interesting or learn from. Anything from current research to classical
  results.

- The length and thoroughness can vary, anything from "survey of this field" to
  "summary of cool paper" to "interesting technical lemma" to "something cool I
  learnt this week", etc.

- You don't need to be an expert on the topic to write about it (as the name
  suggests, there may be some errors, but hopefully also some learning).

- The aim is to convey interesting or useful techniques and intuition (e.g. try
  not to just announce a new result without explaining the ideas behind it)

## Contributing:
Everyone is welcome (and encouraged!) to contribute -- including
non-students, and generally anyone interested in TCS.

The easiest way is to
simply write a LaTeX or Markup document, and email it to me (preetum [at]
berkeley).
There is also a [harder way](/contributing/).

Ideally, both readers and writers would get something out of this blog.
(Personally, I like to present topics to make sure I understand them
fully. And of course, we can have an interesting discussion about it.)

<!--(In theory, the entire source code of this blog is public on Github, so you
can author a new post by compiling and pushing the appropriate files in the
appropriate places. In practice it's rather messy, but details are here).-->


## Comments and Subreddit:
We have comments below each post, which we encourage
people to use to discuss the post.

We also have the subreddit [r/LWE](https://www.reddit.com/r/LWE),
which we hope can be used as a more general
forum among theory students. Feel free to use this for both blog-related things
and general theory questions. Let's see how this works.


## Initial Posts:
We're launching with posts on:

- [Intro to the Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy]({% post_url 2016-6-23-intro-sos %})    
by Tselil Schramm.

- [Pseudo-calibration for Planted Clique Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds]({% post_url
  2016-8-12-pseudocalibration-for-planted-clique-sos %})    
by Pasin Manurangsi.

- [Deterministic Sparsification]({% post_url 2016-7-6-deterministic-sparsification %})    
by Chenyang Yuan.

- [Simple Lower Bounds for Small-bias Spaces]({% post_url 2016-6-3-small-bias
  %}) and
[Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss]({% post_url 2016-5-27-fast-johnson-lindenstrauss %})    
by Preetum Nakkiran.

Thanks especially to the above people (and all future authors) for contributing.

## Conclusion and Open Questions
When conceiving this blog, we had some other
ideas for things that should exist, such as a set of collaboratively-edited
pages on "How to best learn topic X". Are people interested in contributing to
something like this?  In general, any suggestions for things you would like to
see (regarding this blog, or otherwise)?
